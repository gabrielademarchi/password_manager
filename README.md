# Password Manager

This password manager can be used to **generate** and **store** passwords. You can input the website, username and password and add this info to an *.txt* file and, in case you are out of ideas and are looking for a strong password, you click generate password and the program will come up with one for you. 
This manager also has some cool features:
i)  basic validation if you leave one of the fields empty; 
ii) confirmation of infos before add to the txt file; 
iii) the new password generated is automatically saved onto the clipboard so you can paste into the password field of the website you are trying to sign up for.
